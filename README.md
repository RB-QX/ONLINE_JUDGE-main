# CODE INNOVATE GROW ONLINE JUDGE                                     [Visit Website ](http://www.codeinnovate.tech)
This project is a platform for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Docker, and AWS for deployment.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into three main folders:

`compiler`: Contains the compiler functionality for executing user-submitted code.

`backend`: Hosts the server-side logic including user authentication and problem management.

`frontend`: Implements the user interface where users can view, solve, and track their progress on DSA problems.

# Deployment

`Compiler`: Deployed on AWS EC2 and dockerized for scalability and ease of deployment.

`Backend`: Hosted on Render for reliable server-side operations.

`Frontend`: Deployed on Vercel to ensure fast and responsive user interface interactions.

# Features
`User Authentication`: Implemented to allow users to register, login, and manage their accounts securely.

`Problem Solving`: Provides a platform where users can solve DSA problems, track their progress, and see their solved problems history.

`Compiler Integration`: Enables users to submit and execute their code submissions against predefined test cases.

# Technologies Used
`Frontend`: React.js, styled-components (or any other styling library used)

`Backend`: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (or any other database used for user data and problem storage)

`Compiler`: Docker for containerization, AWS EC2 for hosting the compiler

`Deploymen`t: Docker for containerization, AWS EC2, Render, Vercel

# Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

`Clone this repository.`
Navigate to each folder (compiler, backend, frontend) and install dependencies using npm install.

Configure environment variables for development and production environments.
Start each component:

For compiler: Build and run the Docker container locally.

For backend: Start the server using npm start.

For frontend: Start the React application using npm start.
